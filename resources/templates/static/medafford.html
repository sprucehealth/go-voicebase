	<h1>Making Your Medications More Affordable</h1>

	<p>Prescription medications can be hard on your wallet, but we’re committed to doing what we can to help you get the care you want, at a price you can afford. Here are some tips and tricks for ensuring you get the best possible deal on your medications:</p>

	<h2>Tip 1: Ask your Spruce Care Coordinator</h2>
	<p>Your Care Coordinator is there to help you with any questions you might have regarding your prescriptions.  If you find a prescription to be too expensive, message your Care Coordinator with your concerns and he or she will help!</p>

	<h2>Tip 2: Check if your pharmacy does price-matching</h2>
	<p>Ask your pharmacist if they have a price matching program.  Some restrictions may apply, however most pharmacies will match the price of various competitors.  This is a simple way to get savings fast.</p>

	<h2>Tip 3: Look for pharmacy and manufacturer coupons</h2>
	<p>Pharmacy coupons can be used to save money on the cost of your prescription medications.  Many people use pharmacy coupons if they don’t have insurance, or if the cost of the coupon is lower than their insurance co-pay.  GoodRx (<a href="http://www.goodrx.com">http://www.goodrx.com</a>) is a great resource for pharmacy coupons.</p>
	<p>Manufacturer coupons can be used to reduce the out-of-pocket cost for brand name and new medications.  However, these coupons often come with stipulations (e.g., they can only be used for a limited amount of time; they can’t be used with state-run insurance; etc).  Check the manufacturer website to see if coupons are offered for your prescription.</p>

	<h2>Tip 4: Seek out Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs)</h2>
	<p>Patient Assistance Programs offer medications at a reduced cost to patients that are uninsured or under-insured.  Each PAP has different eligibility requirements in which they will require you to complete their application to determine if you qualify for assistance.  Below we have listed a number of websites which assist patients in finding the right PAP.</p>

	<h3>NeedyMeds</h3>
