				<h3>We only support treatment of conditions appropriate for telemedicine</h3>
				<p>The conditions you can be treated for on Spruce have been carefully selected by an expert panel of board-certified dermatologists, based on their confidence that the information gathered through the Spruce patient application — photographic and otherwise — enables physicians to practice at or above the standard of care.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h3>We use evidence-based guidelines to ensure you receive state-of-the-art care</h3>
				<p>You’ll be asked to answer an ‘adaptive’ set of condition-specific questions during your visit (meaning that what you’re asked next changes based on your previous answers). Each question set was developed and reviewed by an expert panel of board-certified dermatologists to ensure it reflects the most up-to-date research.</p>

				<h3>We connect you with great doctors, all uniquely qualified to treat you </h3>
				<p>Doctors on Spruce are board-certified US dermatologists. Each has undergone a rigorous interview process, including full criminal and clinical background checks. All doctors in the network have in-person practices too, so you can expect the same level of clinical expertise that you’d experience in person (or better, if you would’ve otherwise seen a general practitioner).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h3>We take your safety seriously, even if it means helping you find care elsewhere</h3>
				<p>Spruce is not the right place to seek treatment for every dermatologic concern. Sometimes you may require immediate in-person care or a procedure that cannot be done remotely. We ask questions to identify when this is the case, and then work to connect you with the right type of care provider.</p>

			<p>Spruce Health is a telehealth platform and does not itself provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The healthcare services made available through the Spruce Health platform are provided by licensed physicians practicing within a group of independently owned practices, collectively known as “Spruce Physicians”.</p>
