		<h2>What Service does Spruce Provide?</h2>
		<p>Our Service is designed to enable you to obtain telemedicine consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and a licensed healthcare provider (a “Provider”).  Once you are assigned one or more Providers through our Service, each of those Providers may be referred to as “your Provider.”  Your Provider is solely responsible for providing you with medical care.  We act as a technology platform to connect you with professional healthcare Providers who may be available to provide you with certain non-emergency medical care.  We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by Providers, each of whom is responsible for the medical services he or she provides.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: Spruce provides the technology to connect you with licensed healthcare Providers for non-emergency telemedicine consultations, but only your Provider can make decisions about your medical care and treatment.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Is the Service Right for You?</h2>

		<p>In some cases, our Service may not be the most appropriate way for you to seek medical care and treatment. For example, certain medical conditions may require an in-person procedure or very specialized providers not available through our Service. To assist you in determining whether our Service is a fit for your needs, we ask a series of initial questions during registration before we connect you with a Provider. Based on your responses to these questions, we may determine that our Service is not well suited to the particular issue for which you are seeking treatment. In such a case, you will receive an alert notifying you that you will be unable to use our Service for the particular issue you submitted and providing additional information regarding next steps. If this occurs, your registration will remain on file with Spruce, but you will not be connected with a Provider nor will you have established a physician relationship with any Provider. You will not be charged for any services provided to you in connection with your submission if we are unable to connect you with a Provider. You can always return to Spruce at a later time to submit a request for another condition or issue.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: We may determine that our Service is not appropriate for your particular medical condition or issue. If so, you will be notified that your submission has been halted and you will not be charged for your submission.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>MEDICAL EMERGENCIES</h2>

		<p>THE MEDICAL CARE YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDER THROUGH SPRUCE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU MAY NEED.  IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated:  Once again, if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately!
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Registration</h2>

		<p>To use our Service, you are required to set up an account (“Account”).  When you set up an Account, you are required to enter your name, email address, password (“Password”) and certain other information (e.g., date of birth, contact information, credit card information, and medical history).  You agree that all information you provide is true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and promptly update such information to keep it current.  You may not transfer or share your Password or Account (collectively, the “Account Information”) with anyone.</p>

		<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account Information and for all activities that occur under your Password or Account.  You agree to immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of your Account Information.  Spruce reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary, regarding the security of our Service and your Account Information.

If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 and reside in a jurisdiction in which we offer our Service, you may use our Service if your parent or legal guardian has consented to your use of the Service and agreed to the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Spruce procedures.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">

		<p>You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to: (a) interfere with or disrupt the functioning of the Service in any manner, including the functioning of any software, hardware, network or server connected to the Service; (b) distribute or transfer in any manner the Service or any part of the Service to any third party; (c) copy or modify the Service or any part of the Service for any purpose; (d) incorporate by any means any of the Service content into another application, website or service; (e) reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on any part of the Service for any purpose, commercial or otherwise; or (f) use the Service in any manner that is inconsistent with these Terms of Use.

		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Acceptable Use </h2>

		<p>Use of our Service requires that you comply with acceptable use behavior as determined by Spruce.  As part of your responsibilities, you agree that you will not: (a) use the Service in any unlawful manner; (b) use the Service in any manner that is harmful, hateful, harassing, abusive, or otherwise offensive to any other person or entity (including your Provider); (c) interfere with or inhibit any other user from using or enjoying the Service; (d) use the Service as a means to distribute unsolicited or unauthorized communications, advertisements or spam; (e) access or search the Service by any means other than the authorized public interface; (f) collect or use any data or Service content that violates any third-party right; (g) create a false identity, impersonate another person or entity, or otherwise misrepresent yourself; (h) breach or otherwise circumvent any security measures incorporated into the Service; or (i) use the Service in any manner that is considered unacceptable by Spruce.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: You agree that you will not misuse or abuse our Service, and you will not engage in any behavior that may be offensive or harmful to others.  We’re all part of the Spruce family, and we need to protect our responsible users from anyone who behaves inappropriately.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Fees and Purchase Terms</h2>

		<p>The fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers can be found on our Service.  Fees are subject to change, and any changes will be posted.  It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates.  Spruce, on behalf of your Provider, will charge you for medical services provided by your Provider, and you agree to pay for all medical services provided to you.</p>

		<p>You will provide Spruce with a valid credit card or any other method of payment accepted by us (“Payment Provider”) when you set up your Account with our Service.  By providing Spruce with your Payment Provider and associated payment information, you agree that Spruce is authorized to invoice your Account at the time any payments are due and charge your designated Payment Provider account.  If any payments are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction, you also agree to pay the required sales tax, and any related penalties or interest.  Spruce may automatically charge sales taxes for addresses within jurisdictions where such taxes are required.  Unless otherwise agreed to by Spruce, all fees paid are non-refundable.  You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your Account.</p>

		<p>We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to charge your Payment Provider account.  The processing of payments in connection with your use of our Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and the Payment Provider responsible for your designated method of payment, in addition to this Agreement with Spruce.  We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or the Payment Provider.</p>

		<p>At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will your Provider process claims on your behalf.  It is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether your coverage applies, and submit a claim if applicable.  You are responsible for the full fee charged for Provider care through our Service regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: The current fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers are posted on Spruce.  You agree that Spruce is authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales tax that may be required.  Spruce and your healthcare Provider do not currently process insurance claims, and it is your responsibility to submit claims if your health plan provides coverage.

		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

		<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire and final agreement between you and Spruce and govern your access to our Service, superseding any prior agreements between us with respect to Terms of Use.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be null and void.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.  Any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.  The parties agree to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in San Francisco, California, for any action related to these Terms of Use.  You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated or representative action.  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right.  If any provision is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action related to these Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim arose or be forever barred.  You have no authority to act on behalf of or bind Spruce in any way.</p>

		<p>Any use of third-party software provided in connection with our Service, or any third-party product or service accessed or used in connection with our Service, will be governed by the applicable third-party’s license or terms of use, and not by these Terms of Use.

In addition to this Agreement, your use of our Service must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement.</p>

		<p>Any and all provisions of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to be performed after the termination of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination, including, without limitation, provisions relating to ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and governing law.</p>


		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: Any dispute related to these Terms of Use that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  However, please contact us if you have any issues, and we will do our best to take care of them for you.  Your satisfaction is our top priority.

		<h1>Privacy Policy and Provider Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>

		<hr>

		<strong>
		<p>
		Note from Spruce: We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy so you feel comfortable with how your information is collected and used in our Service.
		</p>
		</strong>

		<hr>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into our Terms of Use. Therefore, terms used in this Privacy Policy that have been previously defined will have the same meanings as provided in our Terms of Use. As with our Terms of Use, if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Last Revised” date of the Privacy Policy. Your use of our Service following any such change means you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>We are committed to respecting the privacy of users of our Service. We created this Privacy Policy to tell you how Spruce collects, uses and discloses information in order to provide you with our Service.</p>

		<p>In addition, even though Spruce is not a “covered entity” as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), your healthcare Provider assigned through our Service may be a “covered entity” and therefore subject to the provisions of HIPAA. As a result, your Provider has adopted a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (the “Notice of Privacy Practices”) to describe how your Provider uses and discloses your protected health information (“PHI”). In connection with certain services we provide to or on behalf of your Provider, your Provider has requested that we disseminate to you the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which is <a href="https://d2bln09x7zhlg8.cloudfront.net/npp.pdf">attached to this Privacy Policy</a>. Spruce has agreed that its collection, use and disclosure of your PHI on behalf of your Provider will be done consistent with the Notice of Privacy Practices except to the extent you have authorized additional uses and disclosures under this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>

		<p>By accessing or using our Service, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy; you hereby consent that we will collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; and you acknowledge receipt of your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices. If you are using our Service on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to accept this Privacy Policy and the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices on such individual’s behalf.</p>

		<p class="simplystated">
		Simply Stated: By using Spruce, you’re agreeing to this Privacy Policy and your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices.

Once you have consented to the collection of the precise location of your device, you may adjust this consent by managing your location services preferences through the settings of your device.</p>
