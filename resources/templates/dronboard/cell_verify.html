		Please enter your cell phone number.

		In addition to just having it on-hand in case we need to contact you, we use this number to power two security-enhancing features: (1) the first time you sign into your Spruce account on a new device, you'll be asked to enter a code that we send to you via SMS; and (2) if you request a password reset, we'll similarly ask you to validate the request by entering a code that we send to you via SMS.
