	<h1 class="human">Welcome to Spruce!</h1>

	<p class="human">We’re striving to be a very different type of healthcare company.  Our core mission is to put “patients first,” and we’re passionate about providing you with a great experience.  In keeping with this goal, we’ve inserted “Simply Stated” explanations throughout our Terms of Use.  While the detailed language is a necessity of our legal environment, we’ve tried our best to capture key terms in simple, readable language so there won’t be any surprises or “gotchas.”  That being said, please remember you’re agreeing to all the fine print when you use Spruce, so we encourage you to read our Terms of Use carefully.  Our Privacy Policy is included in our Terms of Use.  We take both the privacy and security of your data seriously.  Above all else, we value your trust.</p>

	<p class="human">One more thing … our Service is not intended for emergency situations, so if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately!</p>

	<p class="human">Thank you for using Spruce.  If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at support@sprucehealth.com.</p>

	<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

	<p>Spruce is an interactive mobile application provided to you by Spruce Health, Inc. (“Spruce,” “our,” “us,” or “we”).  Your access and use of the application or any part thereof, or anything associated with it, including its contents and any products or services provided by Spruce (collectively, the “Service”) are governed by these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”).  The Service is intended for access and use only by U.S. customers.  Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Service.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: You must be a U.S. customer to use Spruce.  Before using Spruce, please read the Terms of Use.</p>

	<h3>General Terms and Conditions</h3>

If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of use for our Service as set forth in this Agreement, you may not use the Service.</p>

	<p>If we need to change the terms of this Agreement, we will post the revised Terms of Use through our Service and update the “Last Revised” date to reflect the date of the changes.  You are responsible for being aware of any changes made to this Agreement.  By continuing to use our Service after we post such changes, you agree to the terms of this Agreement, as modified.</p>

	<h3>What Service does Spruce Provide?</h3>

	<p>Our Service is designed to enable you to obtain telemedicine consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and a licensed healthcare provider (a “Provider”).  Once you are assigned one or more Providers through our Service, each of those Providers may be referred to as “your Provider.”  Your Provider is solely responsible for providing you with medical care.  We act as a technology platform to connect you with professional healthcare Providers who may be available to provide you with certain non-emergency medical care.  We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by Providers, each of whom is responsible for the medical services he or she provides.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: Spruce provides the technology to connect you with licensed healthcare Providers for non-emergency telemedicine consultations, but only your Provider can make decisions about your medical care and treatment.</p>

	<h3>Registration</h3>

When you set up an Account, you are required to enter your name, email address, password (“Password”) and certain other information (e.g., date of birth, contact information, credit card information, and medical history).  You agree that all information you provide is true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and promptly update such information to keep it current.  You may not transfer or share your Password or Account (collectively, the “Account Information”) with anyone.</p>

	<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account Information and for all activities that occur under your Password or Account.  You agree to immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of your Account Information.

Under no circumstances shall Spruce be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of your use of our Service, your use of the Account Information, or your release of the Account Information to a third party.</p>

	<p>Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable right to access our Service and use our Service on the mobile device(s) that you own or control solely for your personal non-commercial use.</p>

	<p>You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to: (a) interfere with or disrupt the functioning of the Service in any manner, including the functioning of any software, hardware, network or server connected to the Service; (b) distribute or transfer in any manner the Service or any part of the Service to any third party; (c) copy or modify the Service or any part of the Service for any purpose; (d) incorporate by any means any of the Service content into another application, website or service; (e) reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on any part of the Service for any purpose, commercial or otherwise; or (f) use the Service in any manner that is inconsistent with these Terms of Use.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to deny use of the Service to anyone for any reason.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: We give you permission to access and use Spruce, and in return, you agree to use our Service responsibly.</p>

	<h3>Acceptable Use</h3>

	<p>Use of our Service requires that you comply with acceptable use behavior as determined by Spruce.  As part of your responsibilities, you agree that you will not: (a) use the Service in any unlawful manner; (b) use the Service in any manner that is harmful, hateful, harassing, abusive, or otherwise offensive to any other person or entity (including your Provider); (c) interfere with or inhibit any other user from using or enjoying the Service; (d) use the Service as a means to distribute unsolicited or unauthorized communications, advertisements or spam; (e) access or search the Service by any means other than the authorized public interface; (f) collect or use any data or Service content that violates any third-party right; (g) create a false identity, impersonate another person or entity, or otherwise misrepresent yourself; (h) breach or otherwise circumvent any security measures incorporated into the Service; or (i) use the Service in any manner that is considered unacceptable by Spruce.</p>

We’re all part of the Spruce family, and we need to protect our responsible users from anyone who behaves inappropriately.</p>

	<h3>Fees and Purchase Terms</h3>

	<p>The fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers can be found on our Service.  Fees are subject to change, and any changes will be posted.  It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates.  Spruce, on behalf of your Provider, will charge you for medical services provided by your Provider, and you agree to pay for all medical services provided to you.</p>

	<p>You will provide Spruce with a valid credit card or any other method of payment accepted by us (“Payment Provider”) when you set up your Account with our Service.  By providing Spruce with your Payment Provider and associated payment information, you agree that Spruce is authorized to invoice your Account at the time any payments are due and charge your designated Payment Provider account.  If any payments are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction, you also agree to pay the required sales tax, and any related penalties or interest.  Spruce may automatically charge sales taxes for addresses within jurisdictions where such taxes are required.  Unless otherwise agreed to by Spruce, all fees paid are non-refundable.  You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your Account.</p>

	<p>We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to charge your Payment Provider account.  The processing of payments in connection with your use of our Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and the Payment Provider responsible for your designated method of payment, in addition to this Agreement with Spruce.  We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or the Payment Provider.</p>

	<p>At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will your Provider process claims on your behalf.  It is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether your coverage applies, and submit a claim if applicable.  You are responsible for the full fee charged for Provider care through our Service regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: The current fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers are posted on Spruce.  You agree that Spruce is authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales tax that may be required.  Spruce and your healthcare Provider do not currently process insurance claims, and it is your responsibility to submit claims if your health plan provides coverage.</p>

	<h3>Privacy</h3>

	<p>As part of the registration process, you will be asked to provide certain personal information.  Any use of such information will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by this reference into these Terms of Use.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: Our Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use, so you agree to let us use your information as we’ve described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h3>Ownership</h3>

	<p>We alone own all right, title and interest in and to our Service, including all intellectual property rights, and any suggestions, ideas or other feedback provided by you or any other party relating to our Service.  Any copy, modification, revision, enhancement, adaptation, translation, or derivative work of or created from our Service shall be owned solely and exclusively by Spruce, as shall any and all patent rights, copyrights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, and all other proprietary rights.

	<p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, our Service, or any portion thereof, with or without notice.  We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise that right.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: We own our Service, and you agree not to infringe upon any of our proprietary rights, like our rights to the Spruce name and logo.  You also understand that any feedback you may provide about our Service will be the property of Spruce.</p>

	<h3>Termination</h3>

WE DO NOT MAKE ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR ENDORSEMENTS OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) WITH REGARD TO OUR SERVICE, OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFORMATION, PRODUCT, SERVICE, MERCHANDISE OR OTHER MATERIAL PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY CONSULTATIONS OR OTHER SERVICES YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDERS).

THE MEDICAL CARE YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDER THROUGH SPRUCE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU MAY NEED.  IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: We help you connect to healthcare Providers for non-emergency care, but we can’t give you medical advice or treatment ourselves.  Once again, if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately!</p>

	<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

	<p>IN NO EVENT WILL SPRUCE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES [WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE] ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OUR SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SERVICE OR ANY SERVICES PERFORMED BY ANY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS YOU CONNECT WITH VIA OUR SERVICE (INCLUDING CLAIMS OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE), EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN THE EVENT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS OF EVERY KIND WILL NOT EXCEED U.S. $100.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL COVER, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION, COMPUTER ERROR OR LOSS OF DATA, AND ANY OTHER INJURY ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR SERVICE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITIES, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY AND THE EXTENT OF OUR LIABILITY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

	<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Spruce, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers, and the officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents of each, from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your use of our Service, your violation of these Terms of Use, or your violation of any rights of any other person or entity.  We reserve the right to control the defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification, and you agree to provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.</p>

	<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

	<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire and final agreement between you and Spruce and govern your access to our Service, superseding any prior agreements between us with respect to Terms of Use.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be null and void.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.  Any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.  The parties agree to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in San Francisco, California, for any action related to these Terms of Use.  You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated or representative action.  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right.  If any provision is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action related to these Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim arose or be forever barred.  You have no authority to act on behalf of or bind Spruce in any way.</p>

	<p>You agree to the use of electronic documents and records in connection with your registration, future transactions and communications involving our Service.  You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

	<p>Any use of third-party software provided in connection with our Service, or any third-party product or service accessed or used in connection with our Service, will be governed by the applicable third-party’s license or terms of use, and not by these Terms of Use.  If you access our Service from Apple’s App Store, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and as such, Apple will have the right to enforce this Agreement.  In addition to this Agreement, your use of our Service must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement.</p>

	<p>Any and all provisions of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to be performed after the termination of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination including, without limitation, provisions relating to ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and governing law.</p>

	<p class="human">Simply Stated: Any dispute related to these Terms of Use that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  However, please contact us if you have any issues, and we will do our best to take care of them for you.  Your satisfaction is our top priority.</p>

	<p><strong>Last Revised: July 11, 2014</strong></p>

	<a id="TelemedicineConsent">
	<h2 class="tele">Telemedicine Informed Consent</h2>

	<p>Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to interact with you, consult with a healthcare provider and/or review your medical information for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or education. During your telemedicine consultation, details of your medical history and personal health information may be discussed with you or other health professionals through the use of telecommunications technology.  In addition, in lieu of a physical examination, your Providers may review photo images or other video or audio recordings of you.  Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information and imaging data, and will include measures to safeguard the data to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Anticipated Benefits:</strong><br>
		Telemedicine consultations with your Providers through the Spruce Application may have the following possible benefits:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>improved convenience and access to medical care by enabling you to remain in your location while your healthcare provider may provide care from a distant site; and</li>
		<li>obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Possible Risks:</strong><br>
		Medical procedures each present risks, and there are additional potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>in rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the Provider; </li>
			<li>providers available through the Spruce Application may not be able to provide medical treatment or provide for or arrange for any emergency care that may be required; </li>
			<li>delays in medical evaluation/treatment could occur due to unavailability of providers or deficiencies or failures of the electronic equipment; </li>
			<li>in rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information; and</li>
			<li>in rare cases, a lack of access to all of a patient’s medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>By Signing this Form, I Understand the Following:</strong><br>
		<ol>
			<li>I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed.  My condition may not be cured or improved, and in some cases, may get worse.</li>
			<li>I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, which I may exercise by providing written notice to support@seespruce.com.</li>
			<li>I understand that the Spruce Application is offered subject to all applicable laws regarding the confidentiality of healthcare information. I have the right to access and amend my health information in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. </li>
			<li>I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. These alternatives include scheduling an in-person consultation with a physician or other health care provider.</li>
			<li>I understand that telemedicine involves electronic communication of my personal medical information to Providers who may be located in other areas, including outside of the state in which I reside.   </li>
			<li>I understand that it is my duty to provide each Provider providing services through the Spruce Application all information relevant to my medical care, including all relevant information regarding care that I may have received or may be receiving from other healthcare providers outside of the Spruce Application.</li>
			<li>I understand that my condition may require a referral to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.  </li>
			<li>I understand that I am fully responsible for payment.</li>
		</ol>
